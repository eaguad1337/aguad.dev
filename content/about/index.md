I'm a software engineer passionate about technology, databases, and sharing knowledge through my blog. I enjoy exploring new technologies and creating simple, instructive guides to help others in their tech journey.

Currently, CTO at [meat.cl](https://www.meat.cl?utm_source=aguad.dev) and [blackdoor.cl](https://www.blackdoor.cl?utm_source=aguad.dev).
